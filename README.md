# Bulb Classifier

When changing  a light bulb there are a few different connection types. This can be confusing for the consumer and frustrating to have to go and fiqure it out on the web. 

If you could just take a picture of the connection and be told which connection it is, this would be highly preferable. 

This project attempts to build a classifier to identify the different bulb types.
